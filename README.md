# Disease Prediction System

This is a machine learning-based system designed to predict potential diseases by analyzing user-reported symptoms.

## Features
- Predicts diseases based on symptoms provided by the user.
- Utilizes machine learning models for accurate disease classification.
- Employs a combination of SVC (Support Vector Classifier), Gaussian Naive Bayes, and Random Forest models for enhanced prediction accuracy.
